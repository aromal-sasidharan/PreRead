- "In a previous project, I worked as a developer in a scrum team with four to five members. There were eight different scrum teams in total. Every week, we started with a technical discussion where we could share suggestions or address any challenges needing solutions. During one of these discussions, the main issue was the need to speed up development and to move away from using native development for Android and iOS. Noticing that our web development was progressing well using React, I suggested we could adopt React Native. This approach would allow us to maintain a single code base for both Android and iOS platforms. Although this would require developing the UI from scratch, we could reuse all the business logic, including state management, API calls, and data models, from the existing JavaScript files or modules created for React."
